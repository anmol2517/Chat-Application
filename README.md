Server is anything that has some accumulation that can be shared. client is simply any other system that wants to gain access to a particular server.The program's premier feature is this whiteboard drawing utility.Users can draw freehand, do circles, squares, lines, text, or paste image files to the canvas.Here Users can interact publicly with everyone else on the server, or they can chat/draw privately using java Chat's "whisper mode".

Users can also create and manage chat rooms, which can be either "public" or "private".The server can also store and manage answering machine-style messages for users who are not online, and instant messages can be sent to those who are.Furthermore, users who arenâ€™t watching their screens can be paged with sound.
